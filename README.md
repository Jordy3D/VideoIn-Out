# Video In > Out
 Designed to work with one of those shitty cheap USB HDMI capture devices.
 Originally to just let me play my Switch through the capture device instead of a TV because laziness; playing through OBS and the Windows Camera application were sub-standard options.
 This is a slightly better option.
 
 May or may not be competing with with [this other application](https://github.com/GlitcherOG/Capture-Display).

TODO:  
- [x] Get video from USB HDMI Video Device
- [x] Get audio to play alongside video
- [ ] Choose Video input
- [ ] Choose Audio input
- [ ] Choose Audio output
- [ ] Display size - IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Render size
- [ ] Ensure this remains superior to [Glitcher's work](https://github.com/GlitcherOG/Capture-Display)

Future goals:

- [ ] Filters
